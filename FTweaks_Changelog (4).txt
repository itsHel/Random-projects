Leveling Revamp (done by Orrie):
- The current leveling system based on skill cost tiers (0-25,etc) limits players choices for points distribution. The new system removes tiers and uses smoohter linear or a progressive (scaling) approach. 
- New skill cost in default settings is based on the current skill level, for example leveling evasion from 20 to 21 will cost 20 skill points, getting skill from 99 to 100 will cost 99 skill points. To offset the new costs we trippled the amount of points that you get from one insight potion.
- The MCM settings are replaced with checkbox to select progressive instead of linear (default) system. The cost multiplier can be used to tweak the costs further.
